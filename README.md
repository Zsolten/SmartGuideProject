Developed an Android application that serves as a mobile tour guide, enhancing travel experiences by providing users with audio guides and detailed information about nearby attractions. 
Key technologies and components used in the project include:
  
  o	Frontend: Built using Kotlin programming language and Jetpack Compose toolkit for a modern, responsive user interface.

  o	Backend: Implemented with the Spring Boot framework using Java, providing robust and scalable server-side logic.

  o	Database: Utilized MySQL for data storage, managed through Spring Boot JPA (Java Persistence API) for efficient database operations.

  o	Location Services: Incorporated Geofence API to monitor regions and trigger audio playback when users enter significant geographic areas.

  o	Background Services: Employed Android's foreground service to continuously provide location-based audio guides without disrupting the user experience.
